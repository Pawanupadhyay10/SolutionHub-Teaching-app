<h2>Solution#Hub-: Social app for helping students to solve their doubts</h2>

## Inspiration🌠
**Academic success is important because working people will need higher levels of education to tackle the technologically demanding occupations of the future.** ... Mostly every student is engaged in improving their day today's study .Really **sometimes getting an exact or amazing apporoch solution of question is not easy,To resolve the dilemma ,I came acroos the idea of solution sharing platform socially** and I builed the **Solution#Hub**.

## What it does🚀

## How I built it🔨

I started off by creating a prototype in **Figma**. The mobile application was built using **Kotlin** and **Android-Stusio** as tool. We made use of **Firebase-Firestore** for authentication and for saving user data.I used **Picasso** libary for string-url to image parsing.

## Challenges I ran into🔴
I ran into some problems with On each item click in Recycler View as to provide different solutions to every question posted on the app.But yes besides it firebase firestore was very new to me, i was challenge task for me to connect my Ui to firestore ,Moreover how to Load images using Picasso Libary from image url. 

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of🎖
I am able to create our proper authentication system along with forget passward option which I never really tried before. I also explored Firestore in a deep way and got to understand how a few things worked a particular way. Making the Nested recycler view work was tough but finally i was able to work properly as to provide different solutions to a single question. 
## What I learned📚
I got more experience in kotlin and firebase-firestore by building this application.  Got to learn about different authentication systems and how everything interacts in the kotlin application during auth. I also wished to integrate vedio solutions in the app and hence got a chance to work around how vedio solution parse using url.

## What's next for Solution#Hub🎉
The current point system that I have is dynamic but I would love to introduce vedio solutions and scaning the question option into the application to make the whole experience even more rewarding.
